# Introduction
**Hello!**  
My name is **Suvaditya Mukherjee**. I am a student of the __Bachelors in Artificial Intelligence Programme at NMIMS MPSTME, Mumbai__.

I have played around and dabbled in many different disciplines of Computer Science in a quest to find out what excites me the most, and I have realized that Deep Learning and its applications in solving Real-world problems are the best way I see myself utilizing my skills for bettering the community.  

I am a former Lead of the [Google Developer Student Club](https://www.gdscmpstme.com) at NMIMS MPSTME Mumbai and the former Co-Head of the Technical Software department at the [International Society of Automation](http://www.isampstme.com/), NMIMS MPSTME Mumbai.  

I have formerly interned for 2 months at [Mosaic Wellness Pvt. Ltd.](https://www.mosaicwellness.in/) as a Software Engineer Intern
